# ✨ Welcome to the Madness ✨

> *"Oh, you can’t help that," said the Cat: "we’re all mad here."*  
> — Lewis Carroll, *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*

## 🐾 Who am I?

Just a smiling cat in the endless garden of code.  
A PhD in the art of making sense of the nonsensical — from unstructured data and graph networks to cloud infrastructure.  
A fan of the beautiful, the broken, and the bizarre — sometimes all at once.

- 🧩 Orchestrator of organized chaos  
- 🐧 Fluent in YAML, bash, and existential dread  
- 🐛 Debugger of the invisible and the inexplicable  
- ☁️ Cloud-wanderer (AWS, k8s, and beyond)  
- 🔄 Automating the madness, one CI/CD pipeline at a time  

## 🧠 What I do

I keep the madness running smoothly.  
Infrastructure as code, logs as prophecy, and uptime as art.

- Terraforming my way through reality  
- Taming containers and chasing pods  
- Building pipelines that (almost) never break  
- Writing scripts that do the job *and* smile doing it

## 💭 Philosophy

Sometimes the best uptime is found through delightful uncertainty.  
I build like the Cheshire Cat smiles: quietly, curiously, and occasionally fading into thin air.
